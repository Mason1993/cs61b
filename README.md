Labs
----
Labs (in 271, 273, 275, 330 Soda) start Thursday.  Discussion sections start
Monday.  You must attend your scheduled lab (as assigned by Telebears) to
  1)  get an account (needed for Lab 1 and Homework 1), and
  2)  login to turn on your ability to turn in homework (takes up to 24 hours).
You may only attend the lab in which you are officially enrolled.  If you are
not enrolled in a lab (on the waiting list or in concurrent enrollment), you
must attend a lab that has space.  (Show up and ask the TA if there's room for
you.)

You will not be enrolled in the course until you are enrolled in a lab.  If
you're on the waiting list and the lab you want is full, you can change to one
that isn't, or you can stay on the waitlist and hope somebody drops.

If you're not yet enrolled in a lab, just keep going to them until you find one
that has room for you (that week).  Once you get enrolled in a lab, though,
please always attend the one you're enrolled in.

Prerequisites
-------------
Ideally, you have taken CS 61A or E 7, or at least you're taking one of them
this semester.  If not, you might get away with it, but if you have not
mastered recursion, expect to have a very hard time in this class.  If you've
taken a data structures course before, you might be able to skip CS 61B.  See
the Course Overview and Brian Harvey (781 Soda) for details.

Textbooks
---------
Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates, Head First Java, Second Edition, O'Reilly, 2005.
  ISBN # 0-596-00920-8.  (The first edition is just as good.)
Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia, Data Structures and Algorithms in
  Java, Fifth Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 2010. ISBN # 0-470-38326-7.
  (The first/third/fourth/sixth edition is just as good, but not the second.)

We will use Sierra/Bates for the first month.  Lay your hands on a copy as soon
as possible.

Buy the CS 61B class reader at Vick Copy, 1879 Euclid.  The bulk of the reader
is old CS 61B exams, which will not be provided online.  The front of the
reader is stuff you'll want to have handy when you're in lab, hacking.

Grading
-------
  10 pts  Labs          There are 200 points total you can earn in this course,
  20 pts  Homeworks     broken down at left.  185+ points is an A+, 175-184 is
  70 pts  Projects      an A, and so on down to D- (85-94).  There is NO CURVE.
  25 pts  Midterm I     Late homeworks and labs will NOT be accepted, period.
  25 pts  Midterm II    Late projects are penalized 1% of your score for every
  50 pts  Final Exam    two hours by which you miss the deadline.
 -------
 200 pts

There will be three projects, worth 20, 30, and 20 points respectively.  You
will do the first project individually, and the last two as part of a group of
two or three students.  You may not work alone on the last two projects.
All homeworks and projects will be turned in electronically.

Cheating
--------
...will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
1)  "No Code Rule":  Never have a copy of someone else's program in your
    possession and never give your program to someone else.
2)  Discussing an assignment without sharing any code is generally okay.
    Helping someone to interpret a compiler error message is an example of
    permissible collaboration.  However, if you get a significant idea from
    someone, acknowledge them in your assignment.
3)  These rules apply to homeworks and projects.  No discussion whatsoever in
    exams, of course.
4)  In group projects, you share code freely within your team, but not between
    teams.

Goals of CS 61B
---------------
1)  Learning efficient data structures and algorithms that use them.
2)  Designing and writing large programs.
3)  Understanding and designing data abstraction and interfaces.
4)  Learning Java.
